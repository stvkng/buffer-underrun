This site is hosted by GitHub Pages.  GitHub may collect some personal information such as your IP address to maintain the integrity and security of their service and to comply with their legal obligations.  GitHub's privacy statement can be found [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).

This site uses Google Analytics to collect aggregated, anonymised web site usage statistics.  This information is used to observe how the site is used and what type of content proves to be popular.  Google will receive details of which web site pages are being viewed, along with your IP address and potentially other information such as details about the type of web browser and device you are using.

Google Analytics is configured to anonymise your IP address as soon as it is technically feasible so that your full IP address is never written to disk.  See [this document](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en) for more information on IP anonymisation in Google Analytics.

In addition, Google Analytics on this site is configured **not** to store tracking cookies on your device.

Other than that, this is a static web site.  I do not solicit or store any other personal information for any other purpose.
